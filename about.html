    <h1>About Driv‑en</h1>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Driv‑en exists to bring clarity, accountability, and operational control to industries where work happens in the field, not behind a desk. Contractors, pipeline teams, and industrial operators rely on workflows that must be simple, reliable, and audit‑ready. Driv‑en delivers that with a modular platform built for real‑world operations.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
        We unify equipment, safety, projects, and pipeline workflows into one platform. Each module is designed to stand alone or work together, giving teams the flexibility to start small and scale as they grow.
    </p>

    <p>Driv‑en helps organizations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce paperwork</li>
        <li>Improve safety compliance</li>
        <li>Track equipment and maintenance</li>
        <li>Standardize project reporting</li>
        <li>Maintain audit‑ready documentation</li>
        <li>Gain real‑time visibility across operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Driv‑en Was Built</h2>
    <p>
        Most operational teams are forced to choose between overly complex software or scattered spreadsheets. Neither option works in the field. Driv‑en was built to solve that problem with clean, modular workflows, field‑friendly design, clear documentation, reliable data capture, and a platform that adapts to the way teams actually work.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
        We focus on operational clarity. Every module, form, and workflow is designed to be easy to use, fast to complete, consistent across teams, audit‑friendly, and configurable without complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>Founder Story</h2>
    <p>
        Driv‑en was created by Jackie Blood, a founder and operational architect with deep experience in safety, compliance, and field execution. After years of developing policies and procedures for contractors and industrial clients, Jackie saw the need for a platform that was both powerful and practical.
